## Project Summary

This website solves the issue of managing and distributing excess food. It will enable the food providers (Restaurants or dinings) to connect and give food to interested users. The website will contain the profiles of food providers and the users who will be the potential consumers of the food. The food providers can post an update on the website about the amount of excess food and the type of food available, and interested users can reserve it via the website. 

In addition to this, the registered users will also be notified via email based on personalized preferences. The website will also display the statistics of the food donated throughout the month/year. Also, the restaurants will be given the analysis of the monthly/weekly food wastage. This will help the food providers to make decisions towards reducing the excess food.
